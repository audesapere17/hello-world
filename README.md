# hello-world

I'm brand new to programming. My goal is to become a blockchain developer. The first tutorial I'm following wants me to use git, as everything else in the programming world seems to, so I figured it was about time I learned. Something tells me I'll be using git a lot, so it makes sense to learn it well.
